                    GNG 5901 is a 0-credit continuing activity that indicates you’re getting work experience relevant to your program. GNG 5902 is a 6-credit course that requires
                    completion of the significant graduate level project relevant to industry usually performed by team that has mentor form the industry who is interested in the project
                    and will guide it. GNG 5902 does not require that you have a paid internship with a company, the experience of working on a project with the mentor is the internship experience.
                    However, students who have found an internship or coop work placement may find that their employer is willing to be a mentor for a 5902 project. Students are allowed to work at
                    their mentor’s place of employment while working on the project even if they do not have a paid internship.

                    Yes, to be eligible for this course, you must have completed the GNG 5301 course and earned at least 9 credits at the university but the requirements for GNG 5301 can be waived if
                    the student has been registered in a co-op program or if they have a significant work experience. If you would like a prerequisite waiver to submit a prerequisite waiver request similarly
                    if you’re going to be registered for 3 units of coursework during the internship (with the employer’s permission) then 6 units completed may be sufficient.

                    Your study permit authorizes you to work up to 20 hours a week off campus and also work on campus (no limit specified) during an academic term when you are studying full-time.
                    Your study permit authorizes you to work full-time during regularly scheduled breaks if you are registered as a full-time student in the period preceding and following the break.
                    For immigration purposes, the summer term (May to August) for non-thesis Master programs at the Faculty of Engineering is considered a regularly scheduled break approved by the University.
                    If you have secured a full-time internship directly related to your field of study in the fall (September to December) or winter (January to April) term, you will need to have a co-op work permit
                    to be able to work more than 20 hours a week off campus. You do not need a co-op work permit to find an internship, but you need one to be able to work full time at this internship during the academic term.
                    To receive a letter from the Graduate Studies Office to apply for the co-op work permit, you need to get the offer of employment from the company offering the internship first.

                    Enrolling in this course ensures your full-time status during your internship, which means it should not have a negative impact on your Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) eligibility as long as you meet all PGWP eligibility criteria.
                    However, each student situation is different and each student needs to understand their VISA and the relevant IRCC regulations. Check with the Professional development club to see what recent student’s experience has been, or check with
                    the uOttawa International Office, or check with Olga Golovachova who is Manager, International Affairs for the Faculty of Engineering.
